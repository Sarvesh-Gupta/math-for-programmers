# Mathematical Proofs

## Keywords
* Set. X = {1,2,3,4,5}
* Set-builder expression. 
    ```
    [n*n: n = 1...5]    
    [n|P(n)]
    ```
* Set-Membership operator.  \epsilon "belongs to"
* Common sets
    * Natural numbers **N** = {1,2,3,...} :zap: 0 is not natural number
    * Integers **Z** = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
