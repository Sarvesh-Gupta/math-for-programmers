# Mathematical Proofs

## Keywords
* Set. X = {1,2,3,4,5}
* Set-builder expression. 
    ```
    [n*n: n = 1...5]    
    [n|P(n)]
    ```
* Set-Membership operator.  \epsilon "belongs to"
* Common sets
    * Natural numbers **N** = {1,2,3,...} :zap: 0 is not natural number
    * Integers **Z** = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}

## Proposition and Predicate
A proposition is a statement which is either true or false and doesn't depend on any parameters. 

A predicate is proposition whose truth value depends on the parameters specified in the proposition. (i.e.,)x +3 =5 is predicate whose value depends on the value of x.

## Axiom
Accepted statement of fact.

## Implication 
An implication p => q is true if p is false or q is true (p == false || q == true)

It is also referred as **If p, then q**, i.e. *conditional statement*

|p|q|p=>q|
|---|---|---|
|T|T|T|
|T|F|F|
|F|F|T|
|F|T|T|
